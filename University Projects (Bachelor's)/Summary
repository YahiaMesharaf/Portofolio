Semester 3: 

- Developing a Self-Driving car: 
This projects was the first big project I worked on. I developed with my team a self-driving car from scratch. We built the car
by ourselves using simple material, then did the System design and system architecture of the Self driving car using MBSE methods
and in particular UML/SysML, then integrated the ultrasonic and infrared sensors and a camera, then we programmed the 2 microcontrollers
we used (Arduino Uno and Raspberry Pi), then we designed a simple app for the live stream of the camera and successfully tested the car 
which worked exactly as we expected when doing the system design. This project was a complex multi-disciplinary project that required
4 months of work to be finshed, but the end result was very satisfying.
